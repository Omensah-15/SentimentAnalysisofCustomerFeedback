# Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

This project focuses on analyzing customer sentiments from feedback collected across multiple platforms using natural language processing (NLP). The goal is to classify feedback as **Positive** or **Negative**, visualize patterns across **location**, **platform**, and **confidence scores**, and derive insights that can help businesses improve their services and engagement strategies.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **1000 synthetic customer feedback entries** across platforms such as **Yelp, Amazon, IMDb, Spotify, Online Stores**, and more. Each record includes sentiment labels and a confidence score for how certain the model is about the classification.

### Dataset Columns:

| Column             | Description                                                   |

| `Date/Time`        | Timestamp of when the feedback was given                      |
| `User ID`          | Anonymized unique identifier for users                        |
| `Location`         | Geographical location of the user                             |
| `Confidence Score` | Model's confidence (0.00 to 1.00) in the sentiment prediction |

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

1. **Missing Data Check & Removal**
   - Checked for missing values in all columns.
   - Dropped or imputed missing values to ensure data consistency.

2. **Datetime Conversion**
   - Parsed `Date/Time` to Python datetime objects for time-based analysis.

3. **Text Cleaning**
   - Lowercased all feedback.
   - Removed special characters, numbers, and extra whitespace.
   - Removed stopwords and performed **lemmatization** using spaCy/NLTK.

4. **Encoding & Formatting**
   - Encoded sentiment as binary values (0 for Negative, 1 for Positive) if needed.
   - Standardized column formats and ensured data types were appropriate.
